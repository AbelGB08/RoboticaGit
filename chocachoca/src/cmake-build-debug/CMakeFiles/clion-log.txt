CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at /opt/robocomp/cmake/robocomp.cmake:99 (ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET):
  Policy CMP0037 is not set: Target names should not be reserved and should
  match a validity pattern.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0037" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  The target name "ICES__home_abel_UNEX_Cuarto_Robotica_RoboticaGit_Practica
  2_myComponent_src" is reserved or not valid for certain CMake features,
  such as generator expressions, and may result in undefined behavior.
